# Guess-My-Number-Game
This is a simple "Guess My Number" game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, the player tries to guess a random number between 1 and 20.


## How to play

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to start the game.

2. The game interface will display a header with the title "Guess My Number!" and a range indicator (between 1 and 20).

3. Enter your guess in the input field provided and click the "Check!" button.

4. You will receive feedback messages indicating whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.

5. Try to guess the secret number in as few attempts as possible to maximize your score.

6. The game keeps track of your current score and high score. Your high score is the best score achieved during the current session.

7. If you guess the correct number or run out of attempts, you can click the "Again!" button to reset the game and try again.


## Styling

The game features a retro-style design with a dark background, a unique font ("Press Start 2P"), and a centered layout. The header and main sections are visually separated, with a clear display of the current score, high score, and feedback messages.
